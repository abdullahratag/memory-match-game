# Memory Match Game

A graphical memory match game built in C++ with the Raylib library. This was created as the final project for DATASTRUCT.

## Features

*   Graphical Interface
*   Four difficulty levels: Easy (2x2), Medium (4x4), Hard (6x6), and a challenging **Impossible Mode**.
*   High score system that tracks the best number of turns for each difficulty.
*   UI with a main menu, gameplay screen, and game-over screen.

## Data Structure Requirement

This project uses a custom **Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT)**. The Stack is implemented from scratch using a singly-linked list and is used to manage the state of the two most recently flipped cards during each turn.

## How to Build and Run

This project uses the Raylib VSCode template with a Makefile build system.

1.  Ensure you have a C++ MinGW compiler suite and `make` installed (the Raylib installer is recommended).
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
4.  Press **F5** or use the "Run and Debug" panel to compile and run the game.
